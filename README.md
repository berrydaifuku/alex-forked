This bot has exactly one purpose.

**Just type "/q" (sans quotes) for a question.** Answer within a time limit. That simple!

We use pretty permissive fuzzy string matching to validate answers—this means you'll likely get credit for questions you got incorrect every now and then.

This bot is developed and maintained for free by a student (me!). It is entirely open-source, and I will never develop a "pro" or "premium" version that costs money. I pay for hosting out of pocket. If you're enjoying the bot, please consider donating to support the bot's continued development and hosting costs.
